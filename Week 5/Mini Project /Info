Project Description

This mini-project focuses on the implementation of an AI-powered cinematic portrait transformation system using pretrained diffusion models. The system takes a single input image and generates multiple cinematic variations such as cartoon style, realistic photography, Pixar-style rendering, anime art, background modification, and Hollywood movie scene effects.

The project utilizes Stable Diffusion XL in a Google Colab environment to perform image-to-image transformation. By applying prompt engineering and controlled transformation strength, the model preserves facial identity while modifying artistic style and background settings.

Objective

To understand diffusion-based generative models.

To implement image-to-image transformation using pretrained AI models.

To generate multiple cinematic styles from a single portrait.


Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the practical application of Generative AI techniques in creative image transformation. It highlights how pretrained diffusion models can produce high-quality cinematic outputs while maintaining structural consistency of the input image.
