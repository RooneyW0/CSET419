# Synthetic Chest X-Ray Disease Classification (DenseNet-121)

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end pipeline** for generating **synthetic chest X-ray images** using a **generative AI model** and evaluating them using a **pretrained deep learning classifier (DenseNet-121)**.

The goal of this project is **not clinical diagnosis**, but to showcase:
- Synthetic data generation
- Dataset organization
- Model inference (testing only)
- Accuracy evaluation
- Result visualization and export

---

### Key Features
- Synthetic chest X-ray dataset generation using a pretrained diffusion model
- 10 disease/condition classes
- No real patient data (privacy-safe)
- Testing-only pipeline (no model training)
- Uses pretrained DenseNet-121 for inference
- Displays and saves prediction results
- Computes accuracy on selected test samples

---

The dataset contains the following **10 classes**:

1. Normal lungs (healthy anatomy)
2. Pneumonia
3. COVID-like opacities
4. Lung opacity
5. Pleural effusion
6. Pneumothorax
7. Lung nodules
8. Lung fibrosis
9. Cardiomegaly
10. Medical devices (pacemaker, tubes)

Each class contains synthetically generated chest X-ray images.
